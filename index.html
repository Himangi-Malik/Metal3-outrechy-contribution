            <p>
                The metal3 is a certified CNCF Sandbox project developed by Red Hat Software. It provides for bare metal host management with Kubernetes. You can enrol your bare metal machines, provision operating system images, and then, if you like, deploy Kubernetes clusters to them. From there, operating and upgrading your Kubernetes clusters can be handled by Metal3. It is a revolutionary tool that differs from similar implementations by being self-hosted and does not rely on 3rd parties like google cloud or AWS.
